# reactix
Create React components using Redux

Install with

```
npm install -g reactix
```

Run `reactix` with the name of the component you want to create


```
reactix MyComponent 
```

You may also use a relative path

```
reactix ./components/MyComponent

A folder will be created for the component and will contain the following files
