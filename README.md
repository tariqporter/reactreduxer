# reactreduxer
Create React components using Redux

Install with

```
npm install -g reactreduxer
```

Run `reactreduxer` with the name of the component you want to create


```
reactreduxer MyComponent 
```

You may also use a relative path

```
reactreduxer ./components/MyComponent

A folder will be created for the component and will contain the following files

* **MyComponent.tsx**
